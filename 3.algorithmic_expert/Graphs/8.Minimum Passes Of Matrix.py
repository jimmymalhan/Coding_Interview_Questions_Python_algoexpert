# Problem Name: Minimum Passes Of Matrix

# Problem Description:
# Write a function that takes in an integer matrix of potentially unequal height and width and returns the minimum number of passes required to convert all negative integers in the matrix to positive integers.

# A negative integer in the matrix can only be converted to a positive integer if one or more of its adjacent elements is positive. An adjacent element is an element that is to the left, to the right, above, or below the current element in the matrix. Converting a negative to a positive simply involves multiplying it by -1.

# Note that the 0 value is neither positive nor negative, meaning that a 0 can't convert an adjacent negative to a positive.

# A single pass through the matrix involves converting integers that can be converted at a particular point in the time. For example, consider the following input matrix:

# [
#  [0, -2, -1],
#  [-5, 2, 0],
#  [-6, -2, 0],
# ]

# After a first pass, only 3 values can be converted to positives:
# [
# [0, 2, -1],
# [5, 2, 0],
# [-6, 2, 0],
# ]

# After a second pass, the remaining negative values can be converted to positives:
# [
# [0, 2, 1],
# [5, 2, 0],
# [6, 2, 0],
# ]

# Note that the input matrix will always contain at least one element. If the negative integers in the input matrix can't be converted to positive, regardless of how many passes are run, your function should return -1.

# Sample Input:
# matrix = [
#  [0, -1, -3, 2, 0],
#  [1, -2, 5, -1, -3],
#  [3, 0, 0, -4, -1],
# ]

# Sample Output:
# 3 (The minimum number of passes is 3)
