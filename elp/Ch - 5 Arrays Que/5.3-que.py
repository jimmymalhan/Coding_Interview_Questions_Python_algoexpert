# Multiply two aribitary precision integers

# Write a program that takes two arrays representing integers, and returns an integer representing their product.
# For example, since 193707721 x -761838257287 = -127573952589676412927, if the inputs are {1,9,3,7,0,7,7,2,1} and
# {-7,6,1,8,3,8,2,5,7,2,8,7}, your function should return {-1,4,7,5,7,3,9,5,2,5,8,9,6,7,6,4,1,2,9,2,7}

# Hint: Use arrays to simulate the grade-school multuplication algorithm
