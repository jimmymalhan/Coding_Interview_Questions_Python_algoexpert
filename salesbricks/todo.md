1. Define Data Model/Schema:
Develop a schema that supports multi-tenancy and captures the complexity of the events, such as ORDER_CLOSED_WON, ORDER_TERMINATED, etc.
Ensure that the schema can handle upgrades, recasts, and the calculation of recognized and forecasted revenue.

2. Outline the Underlying Infrastructure:
Specify the webserver technology (e.g., Apache, Nginx) that will efficiently handle real-time data processing.
Choose appropriate middleware or message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle event streams.
Define the storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL for ACID compliance, Cassandra for high availability) that supports quick writes and reads.

3. Design Real-Time Data Processing Mechanism:
Utilize stream processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Flink, Spark Streaming) to process events as they come in.
Outline how data will be aggregated from these streams to update dashboards in real-time.

4. Develop API Endpoints:
Create APIs for fetching real-time data and historical data based on various filters (Date range, Buyer, Brick).

5. Implement Front-End Visualizations:
Design interactive charts that display forecasted revenue and subscription states using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js.
Ensure that the UI can update dynamically as new data flows in from the backend.

6. Ensure Scalability and Performance:
Plan for scaling the infrastructure horizontally as the number of users or data volume increases.
Optimize queries and indices to meet the requirement that data load in a few seconds.

7. Setup Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the systemâ€™s health and performance.
Set up logging (e.g., ELK stack) for debugging and tracking the lifecycle of events.

8. Security Considerations:
Ensure data isolation between different tenants.
Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to the API and data.

9. Prepare Documentation:

Document the entire architecture, API usage, and front-end integration points.
Include examples and typical use cases to assist developers and users in understanding how to interact with the system.

10. Plan for Testing and Deployment:

Outline a strategy for unit testing, integration testing, and load testing.
Define the deployment pipeline using CI/CD practices.
