 *
 * Testing

 * 6. Write tests for the API to ensure it behaves correctly with various search and pagination parameters. Use tools like Postman

# Set Up the Node.js Project

Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init in your project directory.
Install necessary dependencies: express for creating the REST API, mongoose if using MongoDB as the database, and dotenv for managing environment variables.
Database Schema Design

Analyze the restaurants.json data structure. Plan a MongoDB schema that corresponds to this structure. Mongoose can be used to define a model for the restaurant data, including types for nested objects like address and arrays like grades.
2. Database Setup and Data Import

Set up a MongoDB database. You can use a local MongoDB server or a cloud-based MongoDB database like MongoDB Atlas.
Write a script in Node.js that uses the Mongoose model to import the restaurants.json file into your MongoDB database. This script reads the JSON file, parses it into JavaScript objects, and inserts the data into the database.
Develop the REST API

Create a basic server using Express.js.
Define a REST API endpoint /search that allows users to search for restaurants by name, cuisine, and address. Implement query parameters to filter the search results.
Implement pagination in your API. Use query parameters like page and limit to allow users to specify which page of results they want to see and how many results per page should be shown.
Optimize Database Queries

Ensure that your MongoDB queries are efficient. Use indexes on fields that are frequently searched or used to filter results, such as name, cuisine, and fields within address.
Test different query structures to find the most efficient way to retrieve data based on the API's search criteria.
Testing

Write tests for your API to ensure it behaves correctly with various search and pagination parameters.
Use Postman or a similar tool to manually test your API endpoint, ensuring it returns the expected results and handles edge cases properly.
API Documentation

Document your API endpoint, including the available query parameters and examples of requests and responses. You can use a README file, OpenAPI specification, or a Postman collection for this purpose.
Deployment

Choose a hosting platform for your Node.js application. AWS Lambda, Heroku, or a similar service can be used for deployment.
Deploy your application, ensuring that it's properly configured to connect to your MongoDB database in the production environment.
Optional: Frontend Development

If desired, create a simple frontend that makes use of your REST API. This could be a web page that allows users to input search criteria, sends a request to your API, and displays the results.
Deploy the frontend so that users can access it online.


# Api specification as one of the following
- Postman included into the repository
- OpenApi(former Swagger) specification
- create readme
- list api endpoint
[optional] frontend that presents functionality on the backend & link
