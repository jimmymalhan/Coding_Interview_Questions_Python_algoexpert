# A swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

# A circular array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.

# Given a binary circular array nums, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.

# Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
# [0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
# [0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
# [1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
# There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
# Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.

    def minSwaps(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        # use sliding window to find the first index of 1
        # use a set to check if every element is unique

    nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
    print(Solution().minSwaps(nums))
