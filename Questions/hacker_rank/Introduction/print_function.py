# The included code stub will read an integer, n, from STDIN. Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
#       123...n
# Note that "" represents the consecutive values in between.

# Example
# n = 5
# Print the string 12345.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer n.

# Constraints
# 1<=n<=150

# Output Format
# Print the list of integers 1 from through n as a string, without spaces.

# Sample input 
# n = 3
# sample Output = 123
