# Project To-Do List

## Core Logic

- [ ] **To-Do 1:** Create a clear outline of the core logic you plan to implement for the project. This will serve as your roadmap and guide for development.

- [ ] **To-Do 2:** Begin coding the classes and functions required for your project. Ensure that your code is clean, efficient, and well-commented for better maintainability and collaboration with other developers. Reusability of code components should be a priority.

**Python Libraries and Dependencies:**

- You must set up a virtual environment (venv) to isolate your project's dependencies.

**Required Libraries:**

1. **defaultdict**: Use this module from the `collections` library to work with dictionaries efficiently.

2. **itertools**: Utilize the functions provided by `itertools` for iterable manipulation and efficient looping.

3. **collections**: Leverage the features of the `collections` library for data structures like deque and defaultdict.

4. **functools**: Utilize the `functools` library for higher-order functions and operations on callable objects.

5. **aiofiles**: Employ `aiofiles` for asynchronous file operations in your project.

6. **asyncio**: Use the `asyncio` library for handling asynchronous operations and threading.

7. **aiohttp**: Implement HTTP requests and communication with web services using the `aiohttp` library.

8. **pytest**: Utilize `pytest` for writing and running unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.

9. **sphinx**: Use Sphinx for generating documentation for your project, making it easier for others to understand and contribute.

10. **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement advanced try-except blocks for robust error handling within your codebase.

11. **Logging Library**: Replace print statements with a logging library to maintain clear logs and track issues effectively.

**Optional Enhancements (Can Do):**

- These are optional enhancements that you can consider based on your project's requirements and scalability:

1. **Database Setup**: If your project involves database operations, consider using `asyncpg` and `sqlalchemy` for efficient database connectivity.

2. **API Development**: If your project includes an API, use `fastapi` along with `uvicorn` for creating robust APIs.

3. **Testing**: Continue using `pytest` for testing, ensuring that your project remains reliable and error-free.

4. **Containerization**: Dockerize your project to package it into containers for easy deployment and scalability.

5. **Orchestration**: Deploy your project on Kubernetes for efficient container orchestration.

6. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring using Prometheus to track the performance and health of your project.

Keep in mind that the selection of libraries and enhancements should align with your project's specific goals and requirements.
