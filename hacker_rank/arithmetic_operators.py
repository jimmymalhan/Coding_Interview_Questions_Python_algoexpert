# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
a = 3
b = 2

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print(a + b)
#     print(a - b)
#     print(a * b)

# or

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('{0} \n{1} \n{2}'.format((a + b), (a - b), (a * b)))
